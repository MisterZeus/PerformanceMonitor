.SYNOPSIS
Uninstalls the PerformanceMonitor Darling service and removes the viewer shortcuts.

.DESCRIPTION
Run from an ELEVATED PowerShell. Stops and deletes the Windows service, removes the scoped Windows
Firewall rules it installed, and removes the Desktop / Start Menu 'Darling Viewer' shortcuts.
DELIBERATELY LEFT IN PLACE: the extracted program folder,
darling.json, and everything under %ProgramData%\PerformanceMonitorDarling (the PostgreSQL store
with all collected history, the DPAPI credential files, and the service logs) - so an uninstall
is reversible by simply re-running install-darling.ps1. To destroy the collected data too, pass
-PurgeData and answer the confirmation.

.PARAMETER PurgeData
ALSO delete %ProgramData%\PerformanceMonitorDarling - the entire PostgreSQL store (all collected
history), the generated store credentials, and the service logs. Irreversible; prompts.

# Scoped firewall rules (#1771). Created by install-darling.ps1 because the service account cannot create
# them; removed here for the same reason - nothing else ever will, and leaving an inbound allow rule behind
# for a service that no longer exists is exactly the litter an uninstall should clear.
#
# Matched by the shared DisplayName PREFIX rather than by rebuilding each port-specific name, so a store/MCP/
# web rule left over from a PREVIOUS port is removed too - reconstructing names from the current darling.json
# would strand those, and darling.json may not even be readable at this point. The C# side pins this literal
# against all three real rule-name builders (DarlingFirewallCheck.RuleNamePrefix), so a rename cannot silently
# orphan rules here. A wildcard that matches nothing is not an error (verified), but the try/catch keeps a
# firewall hiccup from aborting the rest of an uninstall under ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'.
