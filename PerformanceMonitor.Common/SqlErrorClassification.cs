/// <summary>
/// The single source of truth for how a SQL Server error number is judged.
///
/// Three questions are asked about errors across the products, and they must never disagree:
///
///   "Is this temporary — should we retry?"              <see cref="IsTransient"/>
///   "Does this login lack rights to master?"            <see cref="IsMasterAccessDenied"/>
///   "Should database-scoped collection go single-DB?"   <see cref="ShouldFallBackToSingleDatabase"/>
///
/// The last two are deliberately NOT the same question, which is the #1631 lesson: an error can make
/// the single-database fallback the right move without saying anything about the login's rights.
///
/// The retryable set MUST be disjoint from both. Issue #1506 is what happens when it isn't: error 40613
/// ("database not currently available, please retry later") sat on the retryable list AND on the
/// give-up list at the same time, so the same error meant both "this will pass" and "this is
/// forever" depending on which code path saw it first.
///
/// These lists lived separately in Lite and in Darling, which is how the bug was ported from one
/// to the other. They live here now so that cannot happen again, and so the disjointness invariant
/// can be asserted from both test suites. Plain integers, no SqlClient dependency, so every project
/// can reference this regardless of how it talks to SQL Server.

    ///   40615 — "client with IP address ... is not allowed to access the server". Azure SQL DB has two

    ///           client whose IP matches a database-level rule is granted a connection to that database
    ///           even with no server-level rule permitting it, while <c>master</c> (where server-level
    ///           rules live) still requires a server-level rule. So "blocked at the server, allowed at
    ///           the database" is a real, fully supported configuration — Microsoft in fact recommends
    ///           database-level rules "whenever possible" — and it is exactly what #857 shipped for.

    /// path on the mistaken premise that "the same rule blocks that connection too". It does not, and
    /// #1631 was the result: every database-scoped collector failed outright on a server whose user
    /// database was perfectly reachable.

    /// expires (15 minutes), is cleared when a server returns from an outage, and is skipped entirely

    /// server with no database-level rule therefore just fails its fallback attempt with the same 40615,
